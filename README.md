#chrispopTheme
##General
This is the template of my Wordpress Blog which you can visit at [chrispop.de](http://chrispop.de).  
This template is a highly modified version of the [html5blank template](http://html5blank.com). (Please see Credits section of this file for further information).

Feel free to use this template on your own blog and modify it as you wish. Please note that I will not guarantee any support on this template, nor guarantee that it is working.  

Also, please note that you need to include the MIT License of both, the author of html5blank an me.

##Required Plugins
Some Plugins are required for this theme to work properly. I believe it is possible to run the theme out of the box without these plugins installed, but I would not guarantee it.  
The theme is using the following plugins:  
* DFLL  
* Advanced Custom Fields

(*This list is not complete, also there are links missing and youd need the backup file of the custom fields*)

##Development
TBD
